# Simulation Tool for COVID-19

The arising debates on the effect of the COVID-19 vaccinations and the increasing infection rates in the winter of 2022 due to the Omicron variant motivated us to create a transparent tool that simulates the spread of COVID-19 through a population. 
The user can adjust parameters like infection rate, vaccination rate, governmental restrictions, or choose from presets, such as a stadium scenario.
